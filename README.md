# DataScience_FirstProject

We have added sample codes for analysing player's performance in different series of cricket matches.
We have also analysed their batting bowling performance, their strike rate,etc.

We have also done Webscraping of Cricinfo website by getting data of one player online and sending in a GET request and extracting player's batting, bowling avergae and strike rate.
